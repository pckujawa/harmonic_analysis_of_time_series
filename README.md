# Harmonic analysis of time series in python
An answer to [python - Harmonic analysis of time series applied to arrays - Code Review Stack Exchange](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/71489/harmonic-analysis-of-time-series-applied-to-arrays), which derived from [MATLAB Implementation of Harmonic ANalysis of Time Series (HANTS) - File Exchange - MATLAB Central](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/38841-matlab-implementation-of-harmonic-analysis-of-time-series--hants-).

Brain dump and more documentation on the process is at [HANTS optimization (harmonic analysis of time series) - Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yi1ck6m5KD81Oqfw3xR1Yl6G8M2n3zBHU7DdFkOMzNo/edit?hl=en#).
